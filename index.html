     <p>It is often said that the United States was "born of an idea."   <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+HKS101A_1+2T2018/courseware/40cbfb0d44a649b99b1692ad35ee57f8/385b251e4bb7417a81896183015b7476/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AHarvardX%2BHKS101A_1%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%401505da5f2f204d7793ae540147b1108d">Source</a> <p>
    It is not an entirely untrue statement.  But it neglects the more important question: if America was born or an idea, of what was the idea born?<p>
    We could say the idea was born of thinking.  That the thinking was born of observation. The observation being that monarchy, and the notion of some men being born 'better' than other men, was inherently unjust and untenable.  Nay, even a defiance of the will of The Creator.  However many people had observed monarchy's  endless capacity to increase the suffering of 'the people,' well before our 'founding fathers' came along.  Why were they so moved by the pain of the common man that they were willing to sacrifice their own power and share it with whomever come who may? Certainly, the well-positioned among the colonists could have set up <em>their own</em> system of rule, putting themselves at the top and in power.  What made them choose the higher path?  Well, maybe they were just men of better character.  But then how did they get that way?  And how could that character accommodate this newly-defined realm of human freedom, while continuing along with human slavery?  <p>

    The problem we are running into here is that of infinite regress. Every step of the way, every explanation is a cause, that is some other cause's effect.  The traditional way to end this regress is to resort to magical thinking.  If, for instance, character is bestowed by God, then we have found the first link in the chain of cause and effect, and we can go no further back.  And, if we venture to ask pesky questions like, "Yeah, but, why did God give those men, at that time, that particularly 'democratic' character, and not some other people, at some other time?" such questions can always be answered by saying, "Who are we to question the will of God?" <p>

    Even those who would scoff at enlisting some notion of the divine to resolve the infinite regression ultimately settle, on notions that whiff of magic.  Free will, being the chief expression of last resort. This because the notion of an absolutely deterministic physical universe, even that which extends into the human mind and its mental processes, is insupportable.  <p>

    Okay.  But, for the sake of argument, let's support it.  Let's propose that all human behavior is the result of absolutely deterministic physical processes.  This means that, even though we may <em>think</em> we are making choices, all choices are just another link in an unending chain of cause and effect.  Even our efforts to 'interfere' with this chain are, in themselves, part of the chain.  <p>

    Taking this as given, we have little choice but to adopt the view that all human behavior is the output of some suite of evolved systems, functioning within the environments in which human beings have found themselves over the years. (Notably, this evolution goes back, not just to our ancient hominid ancestors, but way back, through the entire phylogeny of humanity, though out mammalian ancestores, the reptiles, the fishes and all the way back to that first self-replicating molecule that got the whole 'life-cycle' its very first push.)  <p>

    The establishment of the United States was outpout from a program that evolved to split groups.  In the before times, this would have been helpful when groups grew too large or when local resources became depleted and it made sense for half of group to head off on their own.  But, groups exist and are useful to survival exactly because they consist of tightly-bonded members who will sacrifice for one another even unto death.  So, how do you get a group like that to split?<p>

    You have to sew divisions.  And that's where an instinctive program, evolved for just that purposed, comes into play.  Groups within the groups start behaving differently, dressing differently, perhaps elevating new leaders, and adopting new ideas of magic.  Eventually, the two sides sort out, breaking family bonds, previous alliances, etc., not unlike a cell dividing.  Now separation is possible.  It can be a simple parting of the ways, but other variations exist, like picking a big fight, civil war, making an outside alliance, etc.

    Our founding fathers found themselves feeling separate from their group of origin.  The drive for status and power made it hard to bear being ruled by the elders of 'their old tribe.' They needed to pick a fight.  Luckily the British soldiers did a lot of nasty things that made a lot of people angry.  But it is important to remember that reacting to 'injustices' is actually just, well, a 'justification.' The root of the action is the motivation, the drive to separate, which would have been done eventually, one way or another. <p>

    Whatever rationalization they used, however, had to work in a historically unique environment where men were gaining status and power based on capitalist econmomics.  There would have been no way to rally all of those men together, to fight and die, for the reinstatement of a new and better monarchy.  This is not to say that the idea of democracy was born, cynical, as a creature of necessity.  The idea, of course, existed long before, and might have been advocated at any time and in any place.  It is just that, in this unique environment, those advocates were most persuasive because their solution had the best chance of working.  <p>

    This is a better way of understanding the founding of American, if we contrast it with the view that it had its origins in the diligent efforts of a small group of enlightened thinkers. The latter begs too many questions regarding how enlightened a group of thinkers could be while suborning slavery and genecide, treating women as chattle, etc.  But the 'evolutionary' viewpoint leaves nothing unanswered.  A sub-group consolidated its power, came up with a justification that others could rally around, was willing to fight back when it met resistance from the group of origin, and finally achieved separation.  The whole idea of 'democracy and universal sufferage--for rich, white, men only' becomes unsurprising when it isn't couched in some purity of philosophy, but viewed as a reasonable means to an evolutionary end. <p>

    "...politicsâ€”the process through which society settles its conflicts over scarce resources and conflicting values." Really? I smell trouble.
